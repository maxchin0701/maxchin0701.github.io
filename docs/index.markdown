Hello, and thank you for visiting my page! My name is Max and I am a recently graduated aspiring evolutionary biologist who, among other things, loves research, hybrids, and anything R related! To find out a little more about me, please click on the <a href="https://maxchin0701.github.io/about">About</a> section. To find out about projects that I have worked on or am currently working on and mentors who I've worked under, please click on the <a href="https://maxchin0701.github.io/research">Research</a> section. <br>

As part of my work, I've spent some time developing software that expands on existing phylogenetic comparative methods to facilitate broader analysis of discrete character evolution across phylogenies. These have been arranged into various open source R functions, the source code for which can be found in the <a href="https://maxchin0701.github.io/software">Software</a> section. Please feel free to apply these in your own work if relevant, and definitely <a href="mailto: maxchin@tamu.edu">reach out</a> if you encounter any issues or bugs!
