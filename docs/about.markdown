It is only natural for children to dream and fantasize. For me, these dreams primarily revolved around one day becoming like the cool zoologists or ecologists I would spend my days watching on National Geographic or Animal Planet. What’s more rare is for our childhood ambitions and ideal jobs to stick with us as we grow into adulthood, let alone actually turn into something tangible. For this reason, I often find it extremely abnormal that my personal goals and aspirations have changed so little over the 15 or so years of my life that I possess memories of. Sure, there have certainly been some shifts and reality checks as I’ve matured, but for the large part I still feel the same love and passion for evolutionary biology that first got a much younger me interested in the field.<br><br>

I am fortunate to have been gifted a wide array of opportunities to explore my passion for research in evolutionary biology during my time as an undergraduate student. I’ve been blessed in having nothing but the best mentors who have played a pivotal role in allowing me to realize my ambitions and progress further as a scientist. The last four years have been an absolute joy to experience and have exponentially increased my excitement about a possible future in academia and evolutionary research!<br><br>
